## Entity Relationship

This game incorporates the use of text inputs (strings) and mouse click events to navigate through the levels. There are two pre-determined arrays of prompts, which also serve as a check for winning conditions, for two levels of difficulty respectively. An object will be used to store all word-image key-value pairs.

### Functions
```
- displayPrompts - displays prompts in randomized non-repeating order
- compareInput - checks user input against prompt
- countdown - sets the timer for each input
- handleClickedImg - handles mouse clicks to determine a match (word-image)
- resetGame - resets game to initial state
- initGame - holds logic of game and invokes functions to run game
```
